# Handwritten-digit-recognition-and-analyses-with-numpy

This is a Python script that implements a two-layer neural network for classification using the ReLU and softmax activation functions. 
It includes functions for initializing the network's parameters, performing forward and backward propagation, updating the parameters using gradient descent, and evaluating the performance of the model on a given dataset. 
The script can be used to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset and make predictions on new data.
